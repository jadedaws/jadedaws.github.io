      <h1>addendum to my interview with ctv sudbury (05/11/2020)</h1>

		<p>Laurentian University just launched a new campus security app with safety features for Virtual Walk-home supervision and Working Alone on campus. I was interviewed by CTV Sudbury about how this may impact graduate students at LU who are often working alone on an emptier campus after traditional work hours. <br>
    While this app does seem to provide many helpful services to ensure the safety of our students, my critique of the app was not included in CTV's news clip or article: we want to be cautious that failures to check-in on the Work Alone feature do not unnecessarily escalate situations by contacting Greater Sudbury Police Service (an Emergency Contact on the app), thereby putting our BIPOC and minority students at risk for harassment and racial profiling.<br> 
    I have included some links below about how real this threat is across Ontario campuses from both local police officers and campus security guards.</p>
