      <h1>baby's first committee meeting</h1>
    <p><small>11/02/2020</small></p>
		<p>it's me, i'm baby. which means i had my first committee meeting! WOO! imposter syndrome be gone (for now)!</p>
		
		<p>i stressed for almost a month preparing/dreading this meeting - i needed to make sure my proposal and powerpoint were perfect. i was anxious about everything: <br>
		- does my proposal have enough detail? is it too detailed?<br>
		- is it too long? will anyone read it?<br>
		- did i send it enough in advance? is it too far in advance - will they forget?<br>
		- do my slides have too much text? not enough text? too many pictures? not enough pictures?<br>
		- what if screen-sharing doesn't work?<br>
		the list goes on.</p>
		<p>and bigger questions like:<br>
		- have i strayed too far from the original plan?<br>
		- what if they all hate it?<br>
		- what if it is all wrong?</p>
		
		<p>needless to say, i was in my own head a lot. like a lot. i might as well be paying rent.</p>
		<p>but i started to calm down once i sent out my proposal, which i felt quite proud of after being edited by my supervisors. i refined my slides using new science communication techniques i learned from <em><a href="https://twitter.com/luscicomm?lang=en">the amazing sci-comm program</a></em> here at laurentian university.</p>
		<p>above all, i learned to trust myself and what i am doing. my supervisors' calming words of reassurance <b>finally</b> started to sink in and i believed that i belong here.</p>
		<p>my committee meeting went great! the presentation went without a glitch (thank you, skype gods). everyone was on the same page, willing to help out where possible, and very excited about my proposed research. great questions and concerns were raised, but nothing that couldn't be solved with a good, old fashioned lit review!</p>
		<p>i left my committee meeting feeling a little burntout from being so stressed leading up to it and from being the centre of attention for almost 2 hours. but mostly, i felt happy and re-excited about my research! following my supervisors recommendation, i called it a day and went home to unwind and celebrate my first milestone of my m.sc.</p>
